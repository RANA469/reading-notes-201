# text:

● Structural markup: the elements that you can use to
describe both headings and paragraphs.
● Semantic markup: which provides extra information.

## HTML has six "levels" of
headings:

1.<h1> is used for main headings
2.<h2> is used for subheadings
3.<h3> the section under the subheadings and so on

## paragraphs
To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening <p>tag and closing </p> tag

## Bold & Italic
By enclosing words in the tags<b> and </b> we can make characters appear bold.
<i>By enclosing words in the tags<i> and </i> we can make characters appear italic.

## Superscript &Subscrip

The <sup> element is used to contain characters that should be superscript 
The <sub> element is used to contain characters that should be subscript.

## White Space
two or more spaces next to each other, it only displays one space.

## Line Breaks & Horizontal Rules
<br /> a new line
<hr />To create a break between themes —

## Semantic Markup
<em> element that allows you to indicate where emphasis should be placed on selected words 
<blockquote> element which indicates that a block of text is a quotation.


<strong> element indicates that its content has strong importance in bold. 

<em> element indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence in italic.



## Quotations:
1.<blockquote> element is used for longer quotes that take up an entire paragraph.
2.<q> The <q> element is used for shorter quotes that sit within a paragraph.

<abbr> chapter-02/abbreviations.html HTML If you use an abbreviation or an acronym
<cite> element can be used to indicate where the citation is from.
<dfn> element is used to indicate the defining instance of a new term.
<address> to contain contact details for the author of the page.
 <ins> element can be used to show content that has been inserted into a document,
 <del> element can show text that has been deleted from it.
 <s> element indicates something that is no longer accurate or relevant (but that should not be deleted).

Borders (color, width, and style)
Background color and images
Position in the browser window.
2.Text

Italics, bold, uppercase,
lowercase, small-caps
3.Specific
There are also specific ways
in which you can style certain
elements such as lists, tables,
and forms

=CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.
# Properties  
indicate the aspects of the element you want to change
# Values
specify the settings you want to use for the chosen properties.

# Using External CSS
The <link> element can be used
in an HTML document to tell the
browser where to find the CSS
file used to style the page.

href
This specifies the path to the
CSS file (which is often placed in
a folder called css or styles).

type
This attribute specifies the type
of document being linked to. The
value should be text/css.

rel
This specifies the relationship
between the HTML page and
the file it is linked to.

## Using Internal Css
The <style> element should use
the type attribute to indicate
that the styles are specified in
CSS. The value should be text/
css.

# Inheritance
 It saves you from having to apply these properties 

 # js

 A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.
Statements should end with a semicolon. 

You should write comments to explain what your code does.
They help make your code easier to read and understand.
This can help you and others who read your code.

 script will have to temporarily
store the bits of information it
needs to do its job. It can store this
data in variables. 

## data type
1.NUMERIC DATA TYPE
The numeric data type handles
numbers.
0.75 
2.STRING DATA TYPE
The strings data type consists of
letters and other characters.
3.BOOLEAN DATA TYPE
Boolean data types can have one
of two values: true or false.
true

You can also use a technique
called escaping the quotation
characters. This is done by
using a backwards slash (or
"backslash") before any type of
quote mark that appears within
a string 

Programmers sometimes use
shorthand to create variables. 
Once you have assigned a value
to a variable, you can then
change what is stored in the
variable later in the same script.

## RULES FOR NAMINGVARIABLES
1.The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($),or an underscore (_). It must not start with a number. 
2.The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_). Note that you must not use a dash(-) or a period (.) variablename
3.You cannot use keywords or reserved words.
4.All variables are case sensitive, so score and Score would be different variable names,
5.Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores
6.If your variable name is made up of more than one word, use a capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first word. 

## An array
 is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values. 

 var colors;
colors ['white', 'black', ' custom'];
var el document.getElementByld('col ors');
el . textContent = col ors[O]; 

A script is made up of a series of statements. Each
statement is like a step in a recipe.
Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example,
you might specify that a value must be remembered
before creating a calculation using that value.
Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of
information used in the script.
Arrays are special types of variables that store more
than one piece of related information.
JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9),
strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
Expressions evaluate into a single value.
Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value. 

## USING COMPARISON OPERATORS
it is talking about the operators and the if statment the logic that they use it and how to makes loops .
