There are lots of occasions when we
need to use lists. HTML provides us with
three different types:
● Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is
numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for
a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract
where each point needs to be identified by a section
number.
● Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point
(rather than characters that indicate order).
● Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the
definitions for each of those terms.

<ol>
The ordered list is created with
the <ol> element.
<li>
Each item in the list is placed
between an opening <li> tag
and a closing </li> tag. (The li
stands for list item.)

<ul>
The unordered list is created
with the <ul> element.
<li>
Each item in the list is placed
between an opening <li> tag
and a closing </li> tag. (The li
stands for list item.)

<dl>
The definition list is created with
the <dl> element and usually
consists of a series of terms and
their definitions.
Inside the <dl> element you will
usually see pairs of <dt> and
<dd> elements.
<dt>
This is used to contain the term
being defined (the definition
term).
<dd>
This is used to contain the
definition.

Overflowing Content
overflow
hidden
This property simply hides any
extra content that does not fit in
the box.
scroll
This property adds a scrollbar to
the box so that users can scroll
to see the missing content.

Border
Every box has a border (even if
it is not visible or is specified to
be 0 pixels wide). The border
separates the edge of one box
from another.

 ## Margin
Margins sit outside the edge
of the border. You can set the
width of a margin to create a
gap between the borders of two
adjacent boxes.

## Padding
Padding is the space between
the border of a box and any
content contained within it.
Adding padding can increase the
readability of its contents.

## CREATING AN ARRAY 
var colors;
colors ['white', 'black', ' custom'];
var el document.getElementByld('col ors');
el . textContent = col ors[O];

## IF ... ELSE STATEMENTS
if ... e 1 se statement allows you
to provide two sets of code:
1. one set if the condition
evaluates to true
2. another set if the condition is
false 

## TRUTHY & FALSY VALUES
Falsy values are treated as if they
are fa 1 se. The table to the left
shows a hi ghScore variable with
a series of values, all of which
are falsy

Truthy values are treated as if
they are true. Almost everything
that is not in the falsy table can
be treated as if it were true.
