Email Links
mailto

X Links are created using the element. X The element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to. X If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs. X You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" field. X You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.
