Tables
Table can represent information in grid way, using columns and rows. Also, it stored information in cells.


There are three elements that help distinguish between the main content of the table and the first and last rows :

(thead) :The headings of the table sit inside .
(tbody) :The body sit inside it.
(tfoot) :The footer of the table sit inside .
Functions, Methods, and Object

new keyword : to create a blank object. and you can add propriety and method to the object.

To UPDATE a value use (. or []).

To DELETE a property use delete keyword.empty cell otherwise the table will not render correctly.
The rowspan attribute can be used on a <th> or <td> element to indicate how many rows a cell should span down the table.
The headings of the table should sit inside the <thead> element.
The body should sit inside the <tbody> element.
The footer belongs inside the <tfoot> element.
Functions, Methods, and Objects
You can create objects using new as a keyword and then use dot notation to add keys.
You can also update the value of the keys as the same way of creating them.
Object Constructer is used when you have to declare several objects to represent similar things.
You can declare the constructer as you declared functions.
The this keyword is used instead of the object name to indicate that the property or method belongs to the object that this function creates.

# CREATING OBJECTS:
The name of a constructor function usually begins with a capital letter.


You craete of the object using the constructer function.
To delete a property, you use the keyword delete, and then use dot notation to identify the property or method you want to remove from the object.
When a function is created at the top level of a script, then it is in the global scope or global context.
When a function is defined inside an object, it becomes a method.
If a named function has been defined in global scope, and it is then used as a method of an object, this refers to the object it is contained within.
In JavaScript, data is stored as variables or an array.
Objects store sets of name/value pairs. They can be properties (variables) or methods (functions).
When you need to create multiple objects within the same page, you should use an object constructor to provide a template for the objects.
Arrays are special type of objects.
Browsers come with a set of built-in objects that represent things like the browser window and the current web page shown in that window.
These built-in objects help you get a wide range of information such as the width of the browser window, the content of the main heading in the page, or the length of text a user entered into a form field.
The topmost object in the Document Object Model (or DOM) is the document object.
The DOM is vital to accessing and amending the contents of the current web page.
Whenever you have a value that is a string, you can use the properties and methods of the String object on that value.
In JavaScript there are six data types:
Five of them are described as simple (or primitive) data types, which are String, Number, Boolean, Undefined and Null.
The sixth is the object (and is referred to as a complex data type), which is 0bject.
Whenever you have a value that is a number, you can use the methods and properties of the Number object on it.
As with the String object the properties and methods of the Number object can be used with with any value that is a number.
The Math object has properties and methods for mathematical constants and functions.
The Math object’s random() method generates a random number between 0 and 1.
Domain Modeling
Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors.
A domain model that’s articulated well can verify and validate the understanding of a specific problem among various stakeholders.
